Incident commander name:
    - John Michael.

Executive Summary of what happened:
    - Three pods have been detected to run various cryptocurrency miners. The miners include moneropool, minergate, and cryptonight containers.
    - An attacker was able to hijack the cluster and use compute resources for crypto-mining.
    - The Falco monitoring runtime reports the incident and the administrator was able to visualize the suspicious activity in Grafana.

3. Summary of what was affected:
    - CPU resources had a significant spike indicating that attackers made use of compute resources thereby leading
        to high resource usage..

4. Summary of the impact:
    - Significant CPU spikes on the cluster as the crypto pods are consuming resources, as shown on the Kubernetes/Compute Resources panel.
    - Cluster is not able to serve the traffic due to the crypto pods consuming resources.

5. Summary of the remediation steps:
    - Kill pods with command: `kubectl --kubeconfig kube_config_cluster.yml delete pod <pod_name> --grace-period=0 --force`.
    - Verify CPU activity stabilization.
    - Access to the cluster should be restricted to the administrator. This prevents the cluster from being used by bad actors.

6. Summary of lessons learned:
    - We should review access to the Kubernetes API server from administrative terminals and the Grafana dashboards.
    - Admission controllers can also be configured to disallow unknown images to be used to create containers.
    - We can update the priority of Falco rules for the metrics endpoint to the highest level.
